# EODHD Exchange Codes Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for EODHD exchange codes used in API calls and data responses.

## Source
Based on the [EODHD Supported Exchanges documentation](https://eodhd.com/financial-apis/list-supported-exchanges).

## Dynamic Exchange List API

EODHD provides a dedicated API endpoint to get the full list of supported exchanges dynamically:

**API Endpoint**: [EODHD Exchanges API](https://eodhd.com/financial-apis/exchanges-api-list-of-tickers-and-trading-hours)

This endpoint provides:
- Complete list of supported exchanges
- Trading hours for each exchange
- Market holidays
- Exchange metadata

**Benefits of using the API over hardcoded lists:**
- Always up-to-date exchange information
- Includes trading hours and holidays
- Reduces maintenance overhead
- Handles new exchanges automatically

## Usage in API Calls

### Intraday API
For intraday data, EODHD uses the format: `{symbol}.{exchange_code}`

Example:
- `AAPL.US` - Apple Inc. on US exchanges
- `TSCO.LSE` - Tesco on London Stock Exchange
- `RY.TO` - Royal Bank of Canada on Toronto Stock Exchange

### Search API
When searching for securities, the `Exchange` field in search results contains these codes.

### End-of-Day API
For historical data, the same exchange code format is used.

## Important Notes

1. **API Recommendation**: EODHD recommends using their Exchanges API to get the full list of supported exchanges dynamically rather than hardcoding these values.

2. **MIC Codes**: Market Identifier Codes (MIC) are standardized exchange identifiers used in financial markets.

3. **Virtual Exchanges**: Some exchanges (like EUFUND, MONEY, BOND) are virtual exchanges for specific asset types.

4. **Multiple MIC Codes**: Some exchanges have multiple MIC codes (e.g., US has both XNAS and XNYS for NASDAQ and NYSE respectively).

## When to Use API vs Hardcoded List

### Use EODHD Exchanges API when:
- Building production applications that need to stay current
- Requiring trading hours and market holiday information
- Supporting a wide range of international exchanges
- Wanting to reduce maintenance overhead
- Need to handle new exchanges automatically

### Use Hardcoded List when:
- Building prototypes or proof-of-concepts
- Working with a limited set of well-known exchanges
- API rate limits are a concern
- Offline functionality is required
- Simple applications with basic exchange support

### Hybrid Approach:
Consider implementing a hybrid approach:
1. Use hardcoded list as fallback
2. Load dynamic exchange data on startup
3. Cache exchange information with periodic refresh
4. Graceful degradation if API is unavailable
