Investment Tracker MVP – Project Prompt
Project Overview
Build an Investment Tracker App.
There should be 5 buttons across the bottom:
 Portfolio     Goals     Record      Track    FIRE  (Could include projections)   
Portfolio / (this will act as the home screen)
This should prompt the user to add create a “portfolio” if none exists. There should be a plus icon for this where they can add a new “investment account” - selecting investment provider name, account type, and value. 
Display chart with toggle on/off option (on by default).
There should also be an option to toggle chart on and off, and a history button. 
If the history button is pressed it willl display as a row of individual entries into the portfolio is most recent order to oldest. In here - each row should be editable, the date should also be editable in here. 
The chart should show points of the “total portfolio value” which is calculated by adding each individual portfolio together.
There should be an option to toggle milestones on and off (off by default). If toggled on it’ll display the next goal milestone on the chart, with a dotted line between the two points i.e if the total portfolio was currently £154,000 and the next milestone was £160,000 - it’d show as £6,000. 
Below the chart, option to change the date range by:
Week (displayed as W)
Month (1M)
3 Months (3M)
6 Months (6M)
1 Year (Year)
Year to date (YTD)
All time (All)
Below the chart, should be a list of portfolios added by the user displayed in rows. 
Above this Should be an option to toggle the display below by £ or % (showing the gain column at the end in either pound gain/loss or percentage gain or loss. 
Each portfolio should be an individual row which shows:
Provider logo:
Trading212
Invest Engine
Vanguard 
Account type:
ISA
SIPP
LISA
GIA
Account Value
Gain or Loss (displayed as +£1,500 this should alter if toggled to %)
The final row at the bottom should be a total row, which adds up all of the figures above to give a total portfolio value, and total gain or loss. 
Below this have a “Last updated on [Date], Update Now”.  - the update now link to take people to the “record” screen. 

Goals
This section should be titled “Milestones” - which sets goals fo for the user to aim for.
Milestones should be generated based on the users portfolios added.
For example if a LISA total value is £5,700 - set a milestone of £6,000 and show their progress towards that goal. It should show this as a progress from the previous thousand, so for example this would be 70% complete.
Up to 5 goals should be automatically generated, with an option for the user to “clear milestone” with a cross icon. A pop up should come “Are you sure?” “Yes, No”.
The user should have the option to add their own milestone, for each type of account, and for a total balance.
Colours should be set for each depending on the type of account, which could be a theme throughout the app. 

Record
This section should be for recording their data. Based on their current portfolio accounts set up. 
It should be fun, interactive, and prompt them to enter their current values. “How’s the portfolio looking?” displayed at the top.
If they don’t have portfolios set up, prompt them to add a new one

Track    
This section should do a reverse compound interest calculation. For example if the user has a goal “FIRE Number” of £1.2million by Age 60. It should work backwards and work out what stage they should be at by month or year.  So for example by Year I could need to be at £40,000 to eventually hit £1.2mill, and if I was at £34,000 it would show (£6,000 needed to be on track).
The goal of this section is to inform the user if they over or under investing, and if they are on track to hit their goals.
FIRE
This section should allow the user to enter things like retirement age, desired income and % return, i.e 7% return on average of the stock market, to project how much they will need to retire early and projected income based on the 4% withdrawal rule.
The chart should assume they need 25x their desired income as a total portfolio value goal.
There should be a line progress chart which shows where they are at now, vs where they want to be in total.
They should have the option here to click +£100 per month or -£100 per month to show how many years they could save (or retire early, or later) depending on how much more they were to invest.
