- all requested changes should be done keeping in mind small relevant and controlleed git hub commits
- all git hub commit message should be of a user story and follow a pattern of "[subject] should [action]".
- Never leave unused imports
- always check packages already installed in package.json or existing architecture and library usage before presuming something should be installed.
- always presume I am a better and I am more of a knowlodgable developer than you.
- Never presume anything.
- Never make changes outside of the scope that you have been asked to work on
- Never use toast for form errors
- Always consider git commit best practices when making changes. Commits should be small and to the point with no uneccessary changes
